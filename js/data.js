I have taught science for 41 years and retired in 2018 due to bad knees. My intention is to share these ideas with other teachers or anyone who has an interest in science. I have found that designing and building my own equipment has taught me more than any course that I have ever taken. I hope that you consider trying this for yourself.. I also share and show some of these ideas at workshops, science conferences, or inservice presentations."
